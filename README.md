LAB CYCLE 1
EXERCISE 1: Introduction to Numpy
1. Write a NumPy program to create an element-wise comparison (greater, greater_equal, less
and less_equal) of two given arrays.
2. Write a NumPy program to create an array of all the even integers from 30 to 70.
3. Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 identity matrix.
4. Write a NumPy program to create a vector with values from 0 to 20 and change the sign of
the numbers in the range from 9 to 15.
5. Write a NumPy program to create a 5x5 zero matrix with elements on the main diagonal
equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
6. Write a NumPy program to compute sum of all elements, sum of each column and sum of
each row of a given array.
7. Write a NumPy program to save a given array to a text file and load it.
8. Write a NumPy program to check whether two arrays are equal (element wise) or not.
9. Write a NumPy program to create a 4x4 array with random values, now create a new array
from the said array swapping first and last rows.
10. Write a NumPy program to multiply two given arrays of same size element-by-element.

      24                             500<br>
3. Write a Python program to draw a line using given axis values taken from a text file, with suitable label in the x axis, y axis and a title.
4. Write a Python program to plot two or more lines on same plot with suitable legends of each line.
5. Write a Python program to create multiple plots.
6. Consider the following data.<br>
    Programming languages: Java   Python  PHP  JavaScript C#  C++<br>
    Popularity             22.2   17.6    8.8  8          77  6.7<br>
  (i) Write a Python programming to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages.<br>
  (ii) Write a Python programming to display a horizontal bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages(Give Red colour to the bar chart).<br>
  (iii) Write a Python programming to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages. Use different color for each bar.<br>
7. Write a Python program to create bar plot of scores by group and gender. Use multiple X values on the same chart for men and women.
Sample Data:<br>
Means (men) = (22, 30, 35, 35, 26)<br>
Means (women) = (25, 32, 30, 35, 29)<br>
8. Write a Python programming to create a pie chart of the popularity of programming Languages.<br>
    Programming languages: Java   Python  PHP  JavaScript C#  C++<br>
    Popularity             22.2   17.6    8.8  8          77  6.7<br>
9. Write a Python programming to create a pie chart of gold medal achievements of five most successful countries in 2016 Summer Olympics. Read the data from a csv file.
Sample data:
medal.csv<br>
    country,gold_medal<br>
    United States,46<br>
    Great Britain,27<br>
    China,26<br>
    Russia,19<br>
