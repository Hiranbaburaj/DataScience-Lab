LAB CYCLE 1
EXERCISE 1: Introduction to Numpy
1. Write a NumPy program to create an element-wise comparison (greater, greater_equal, less
and less_equal) of two given arrays.
2. Write a NumPy program to create an array of all the even integers from 30 to 70.
3. Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 identity matrix.
4. Write a NumPy program to create a vector with values from 0 to 20 and change the sign of
the numbers in the range from 9 to 15.
5. Write a NumPy program to create a 5x5 zero matrix with elements on the main diagonal
equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
6. Write a NumPy program to compute sum of all elements, sum of each column and sum of
each row of a given array.
7. Write a NumPy program to save a given array to a text file and load it.
8. Write a NumPy program to check whether two arrays are equal (element wise) or not.
9. Write a NumPy program to create a 4x4 array with random values, now create a new array
from the said array swapping first and last rows.
10. Write a NumPy program to multiply two given arrays of same size element-by-element.

EXERCISE 2: Matrix operations (using vectorization) and transformations
Write Python program to create two matrices (read values from user) and find the following
1. Dot Product
2. Transpose
3. Trace
4. Rank
5. Determinant
6. Inverse
7. Eigen values and eigen vectors
